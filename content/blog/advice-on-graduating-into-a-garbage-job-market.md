Understanding if your business is ready for ad spend and at what level is something that can stop any business owner in their tracks. At Sitelab we offer business strategy consulting to help people understand where and when to spend. The unbeatable basis of digital marketing is compared to any other form of marketing, you can reach more people for less by 100 fold. But this can only happen with the appropriate targeting. Google and Facebook make an absolute killing on small businesses in competitive industries that have poor targeting and CPC/CPM limits.





* Body - 

State of your funnel: Website, CRM, and Sales package material. What experience will a perspective customer receive if they click your ad? It needs to be working before you spend money on ads. Then understand without emotion where your business lies in what ad strategy it is needing for the current market. Brand awareness, Ad-lift recall or Conversion focused.

Targeting and Demographics: This should be clear from the start otherwise as a small business, lacking 1st and 3rd party cookies on your customers which can be used to lower ad spend through CPM.

Aim for 'Daily Reach' vs realistic 'Daily Ad Spend Ability': Now that the performance of your current website funnel is understood, and proposed targeting and demographics are clear, it is time to begin getting a basic range for how many people you would like to reach per day, considering the amount of ad clicks * avg CPC conversion rate (10 clicks might equal to 2-3 leads per day). Then compare this with any current known data on the competitiveness of the keyword niche and CPC/CPM limits. Remember that keyword tool gives a much less detailed understanding of your placement in ad ranking then some manual testing. Google will never make this an easy task, and I can't ever see there being a better way. Reserve 4-5 days of ad spend testing to find the best middle-ground between clicks / impressions / ad spend / CPC. With Sitelab Care+, we do these manual CPC limit tests every month as SEO and CPC rankings change daily. This is where many small businesses waste their ad spend by simply not having the labour resources for this managing this constantly.
